## About
HDGPCR: Hybrid-Dataset Genetic Programming with Complex Root method for Software Fault Localization
The folders contain the experiment performed in our published paper entitled "Evolving Suspiciousness Metrics From Hybrid Data Set for Boosting a Spectrum Based Fault Localization".

## Dependencies
1.  Python 2
2.  pyevolve
3.  Genetic Algorithm

## File descriptions
1. HDGPCR experiment.zip: This folder contains two files. a) Formula_Evolve b) Formulas_Comparison. The first contains the python source code for evolving our formulas and the second contains the python code for computing the exam scores to compare the generated formulas with the state-of-the-arts formulas.
2. evolving-sbfl.zip: This folder contains the SIR data set used in the experiment.
3. formula.csv: This file contains the generated formulas.
